Needed a quick set of additional tools to simplify a [demo application](https://github.com/orodio/melbjs-feb-2015) for a [talk](http://youtu.be/d7LIkeBzC7k) at a [meetup](http://melbjs.com/);

Even though the `send` and `subscribe` functions are tested, this code was really just quickly thrown together. If you are looking for some stuff to make your flux life better I would recommend [fluxable](http://fluxible.io/) by yahoo!
